# Introduction 

Python is a general-purpose programming language that operates at high level functionality. There are a variety of reasons why any developers would be interested in using Python in their production process. Coming a long way from when it was initially released in the early 90’s and continuously improving over the years, Python includes a multiplicity of features making it one of the most popular programming languages to this day. The dynamic semantics and syntax enforce a more readable experience for developers and users, while providing the opportunity for complex design. The following is a thorough description of all Python versions 1.0 to 3.11 as well as an analysis of the progress that has been made over the years and the potential of Python in the future. 


## Initial Inspiration 

Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, and it was designed to address shortcomings that existed in the other prominent languages of the time. One of its primary objectives was to create more readable, expressive, and intuitive code. Its syntax is simple with few keywords. Along with its whitespace indentation, it is easier to write, read, and maintain compared to the complex syntax of other languages.
It also needed have more versatility. Therefore, it was designed to support multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional. That flexibility allows developers to choose whichever style is preferred or necessary instead of being forced into particular implementation decisions dictated by the language.
Another important feature is the built-in data structures, primarily lists, tuples, and dictionaries. They were designed to be efficient and easy to use when working with complex data.
Python is interpreted rather than compiled, which allows for the rapid development and prototyping of code. This deliberate choice allows users to debug and develop programs more quickly without the need to compile. Ultimately, Python filled a gap left by its competitors. That being a high level, modular, and efficient language that allowed for flexible yet powerful development.

## Version 1

Released in January of 1994, functional programming was officially up and running. This version included functional programming 
like map, Lambda, filter and reduce features as well as previous features from the 0.9 Python version. Those features included classes with 
inheritance, core data types, exception handling and functions. Python version 1.4 was when Modula-3 style keyword arguments were released as well 
as support for complex number operations. The following versions of Python 1 were license updates, background changes and other optimizations. 
Python version 1.6 released the year of 2000, was the last update developed at CNRI and the only version with an open source license that was 
released by the CNRI. Obviously at this point in time, Python was a new programming language and still had tremendous room for improvement so naturally there would be an abundance of new updates and features to come with the following newer versions. 


## Version 2 

In introducing Python 2 which was brought to the technology world in 2000 created by BeOpen with main purpose for making programming simple with the 
ease for learning the program. Python 2 made code development easier than the earlier versions. Python 2 is an object oriented programming language
as a high level language as the translation of Python code takes place into machine language, thus, using an intepreter.

Python 2 an open source version helps the DevOps engineer with configuration management tools. The history of Python 2.0 ranges from October 16, 2000
to July 3, 2010 ending with Python 2.7. The syntax of Python 2 was noted to be difficult to understand along with rules of ordering comparison that are
very complex. Lisewise, Python version 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2. Also older libraries created for Python 2 is not forward-compatible.
Python 2 is not forward-compatible. Python 2 is not available after 2020. In summary Python 2 made the code development process much easier than its
earlier versions in comparison. See below the key different between Python 2 and Python 3 which determined the fate of Python2 ending in 2020.

## Version 3 
Python 3 was released on December 3rd 2008, and the goal with it was to improve the readability and reduce redundancy in python code. As Python2 had progressed it became increasingly bloated, often with different ways to do the same thing, and it also had known security risks. Therefore they planned a number of features to improve the language. More functions used parentheses to denote what they were operating on, print for example went from the format: print "string", to print("string"). Integer division also no longer always returned an integer, but could now accurately return a decimal number when necessary. Because these were major changes to built-in functions as well as the way that things worked under the hood, the designers realized that it would not be feasible to ensure backwards compatibility with the previous releases, necessitating a new major version. On release, adoption was far from immediate however, as while in small projects porting it would be relatively easy, for large codebases this presents an immense challenge. For example, DropBox claimed that upgrading to Python3 took them three years, and Instagram only recently finished upgrading. For this reason Python2 is still very common in practice. To help with this some of the changes from Python3 were added to Python2 where possible. Support for 2.X versions was ceased in 2020 after originally being planned for 2015, before being extended to give companies more time to update their code. Frameworks like Django no longer support Python2 either and it is therefore purely legacy. This means that nearly all new work done in python is with python3, but python2 has not been fully phased out. This is where we are now, with version 3.11 being the most recent release, having been released in October 2022. 


# Conclusion 

It goes without saying that the transformation of Python has been quite noticeable throughout the years and there are still changes yet to be made. As new versions are curated and new tools are being produced, old versions are faded out or no longer supported. There is always room for optimization and it is important to look back on why and how things were created and brought to life by a specific process. Redundancy is something that is often discovered in the programming industry and therefore the desire for efficiency is strong.
